### Personalized Housing Recommendation Tool

## Elevator Pitch
Our idea is a personalized recommendation tool designed for those in search of housing. This includes students, working adults, or anyone looking to buy a new home. We aim to simplify the housing search process by catering to specific needs. Users input details such as budget, location, amenities, and more. Our tool then curates housing recommendations tailored to these inputs. Unlike platforms like Zillow, we don't merely filter based on user input. Instead, we utilize user data to recommend housing options that are truly aligned with their needs. Our platform encompasses a broad spectrum of the market, from student apartments to retirement homes, ensuring that our users have a comprehensive view of available options.
